# PDBbind Docking

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/254600667.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/254600667)

## Description

Quick and dirty docking pipeline to dock the [PDBbind](http://pdbbind.org.cn/) database with [smina](https://sourceforge.net/projects/smina/).

## Disclaimer

The goal of this pipeline is to generate a series of realistic docking poses in order to test RMSD calculations with [spyrmsd](https://github.com/RMeli/spyrmsd); the results of docking have not been assessed in any way.
